# Project Specification

Suppose by the year of 2035, the game industry in China is extremely booming, where thousands of gorgeous games are sold online and offline. Even though most of the game objects are described in digital files which makes them become much easier to copy and distribute, some players still prefer a physical version of their favorite games with SPs. Also, some players are willing to exchange software to experience different games with a lower expenditure by bartering.

Old-fashioned distribution platforms focus on deliver digital copies of games and provide with a network community and do not offer a satisfying solution of exchanging or bartering as this will reduce the profit of the game publishers. With the increasing demand of more accessible high quality games with affordable price, we are delight to introduce an **Advance Game Distribution Platform(AGDP)**.

### Settings

- **Consumer**: The one who requests some games or offers a game bartering
- **Developer**: The one who develop and contruct the game
- **Publisher**: The one who release the game and undertake the selling
- **Game**: A game is built by developer and sold by publisher, owned by a consumer
- **Frontpage**: Provide a position to exhibit the game and the promoting information

We will provide such functions for Users:
- Shop at the digital content store (purchase games)
- Offer a game to exchange for a wanted game (bartering)
- Comment and rate a purchased and played game
- Browse the store to check the comment given by others
- The platform will recommend consumers with some particular game types they may prefer

As for a Publisher/Developer:
- Launch and release a game at a designated data
- Upload the price and offer discounts during promotion
- Require a position in the frontpage of the platform to advertise their products
