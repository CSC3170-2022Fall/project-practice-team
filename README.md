## Project Abstract

### Overview

In this project, we hope to implement an advanced game distribution platform, where both the consumer, or say the player, and the saler, or say the game publisher can get involved.

As a player, you can either purchase a game like you normally do on any game platform or barter for a game. Bartering is a new concept we try to introduce to our platform. One possible scenario where you may want to barter for a game is you would like to exchange a game, which you no longer want to play, for another game you interested in with somebody else.  Players can put the game to exchange and their wishlist on the platform, and then wait for others to make the deal.

As a publisher, you can upload the game to sell and make purchases with the platform to determine where the sale info will be displayed on the webpage.

In this project, we hope to incorporate as many aspects of database as possible, ranging from normal operations: select, insert, delete to more advanced topics: privilege granting, concurrency, etc. We really try to come up with a real world application instead of a toy model.
